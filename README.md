# An Introduction to Statistical Learning
## with Applications in Python

This repository is based on the exercises from the excellent book [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) by  Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani.

The book focuses on the R programming language which means the included labs as well as the exercises are given in R. Because I prefer Python this repository captures my attempts at solving the given exercises using Python with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/).

The exercise texts are included to simplify understanding the solutions. I hope this _reproduction_ is within the given license from the book.

The datasets can be obtained from google and won't be distributed here. However those are the files I used:

- [Boston.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/master/csv/MASS/Boston.csv)
- [Auto.data](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Auto.data)

The preprocessing in the notebooks targets those exact files.

## Structure

Each chapter contains conceptual and applied exercises. The notebook files are split accordingly.

```

|  |                    |- Exercise type (Applied|Conceptual)

## Corrections

Corrections and contributions are welcome. Probably there are some mistakes in my solutions :)
